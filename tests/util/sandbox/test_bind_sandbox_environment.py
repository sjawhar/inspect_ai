"""Tests for `bind_sandbox_environment` (AGENTC-1744).

A caller that constructs its own `SandboxEnvironment` -- for example a harness
driving a sandbox through a provider Inspect does not provision, outside Inspect's
own eval loop -- needs a public way to make `sandbox()`/`sandbox_with()` resolve it
for the duration of a block. Before this, the only way to do that was to reach into
`inspect_ai.util._sandbox.context`'s private module-level `ContextVar`s and
`inspect_ai.util._sandbox.events.SandboxEnvironmentProxy` directly.
